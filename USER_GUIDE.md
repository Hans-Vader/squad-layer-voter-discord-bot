# User Guide — Squad Layer Vote Bot

## For Players

### Suggesting a Layer

1. Find the channel with the active Layer Vote event
2. Click the **"Suggest Layer"** button on the event embed
3. Follow the dropdown steps:
   - **Step 1**: Select a map
   - **Step 2**: Select a game mode (e.g., AAS v1, RAAS v2, Invasion)
   - **Step 3**: Select Team 1 faction and unit type
   - **Step 4**: Select Team 2 faction and unit type
   - **Step 5**: Confirm your suggestion
4. Your suggestion appears in the event embed

### Viewing Your Suggestions

Click the **"Info"** button on the event embed to see:
- Current event phase
- How many suggestions you've used
- Your submitted suggestions

### Removing Your Suggestion

While suggestions are open, click the **"Remove Suggestion"** button on the event embed to take back one of your own picks:

1. Pick the suggestion to remove from the dropdown (only your own are shown)
2. Confirm

Removing frees the slot, so you can suggest again (up to the per-user limit). There is a per-event cap on how many of your own suggestions you may remove — once you hit it, the button stops working for you. The organizer sets this cap (it can be `0` to disable removal entirely).

### Voting

When the admin starts a vote, a Discord poll appears in the channel. Simply vote for your preferred layer.

### Viewing Past Winners

Use `/history` to see the winners of previous events.

## For Organizers

### Initial Setup

1. Run `/setup` and select:
   - **Organizer Role**: The role that can manage events
   - **Log Channel**: Where bot logs are sent
   - **Language**: English or German
2. Run `/refresh_layers` to load layer data (happens automatically on first start)

### Configuring the Bot

| Command | What it does |
|---------|-------------|
| `/config_gamemodes` | Choose which game modes are available (AAS, RAAS, etc.) |
| `/config_blacklist maps` | Block maps from being suggested |
| `/config_blacklist factions` | Block factions from being suggested |
| `/config_blacklist units` | Block unit types from being suggested |
| `/config_suggestions` | Set max suggestions per user/total, history blocking |

### Running an Event

**Step 1: Create**
```
/create_layer_suggestion
  event_name: Friday Night Fights        (optional — embed title; defaults to "Event #ID")
  suggestion_start: 05.04.2026 18:00     (optional — auto-opens at this time)
  voting_duration_hours: 24              (optional — how long the poll runs)
```

The event name appears as the embed title, in the voting thread name (for gated events), in the log channel, and in the admin panel. Leave it empty to fall back to `Event #ID`. You can rename the event later via the **Edit Event** DM dialog (see Admin Panel below).

**Step 2: Open Suggestions**
- Wait for the scheduled time, or
- Use `/open_suggestions` to open immediately, or
- Click Admin > "Open Suggestions" on the event embed

**Step 3: Collect Suggestions**
Users click "Suggest Layer" and submit their picks.

**Step 4: Close Suggestions**
- Use `/close_suggestions` or Admin > "Close Suggestions"

**Step 5: Select Layers for Voting**
- Use `/select_for_vote` or Admin > "Select for Vote"
- Pick specific layers from the dropdown, or
- Click "Random" to select random layers
- Confirm your selection

**Step 6: Start Voting**
- Use `/start_vote` to create the Discord poll
- The poll runs for the configured duration

**Step 7: End & Results**
- Wait for the poll to expire naturally, or
- Use `/end_vote` to end early
- The winner is saved to history automatically

### Admin Panel

Click the **"Admin"** button on the event embed for quick actions:
- Open/Close suggestions
- Select layers for voting
- End voting
- Delete the event
- **Edit Event** — opens a DM dialog where you can rename the event and tweak per-event config (blacklists, voting duration, max suggestions, **Max Self-Removals per User**, etc.). Pick **Event Name** from the dropdown; submit empty to revert to `Event #ID`. **Max Self-Removals per User** controls how many times each player may remove their own suggestion (`0` disables the player-facing **Remove Suggestion** button).
- **Edit Allow-list** — set which roles/users may participate. This lives on the event embed's Admin panel (not in the Edit Event DM dialog), because Discord's role/user pickers don't work inside DMs.

### Settings

Use `/settings` to view all current configuration at a glance.

## FAQ

**Q: How many layers can be in the vote?**
A: Maximum 10 (Discord poll limit).

**Q: What if no factions are available for a map?**
A: Check your blacklist settings — you may have blocked too many factions.

**Q: Can I have multiple events in one server?**
A: Yes, one event per channel.

**Q: How does history blocking work?**
A: If a layer was suggested in one of the last N events (configurable), it cannot be suggested again. The exact combination (map + mode + factions + units) must match.

**Q: What maps are excluded by default?**
A: Jensen's Range, Tutorial, and Training maps are automatically excluded during layer import and never appear in suggestions.
