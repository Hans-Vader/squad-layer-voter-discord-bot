# Squad Layer Vote Bot

A Discord bot for collecting Squad layer suggestions from users and running votes on them using Discord's native poll feature.

## Features

- **Layer Suggestions**: Users suggest layers via interactive dropdown menus (Map > Mode > Factions > Units)
- **Layer Data**: Pulls from [SquadLayerList](https://github.com/fantinodavide/SquadLayerList) and caches locally
- **Admin Blacklists**: Block maps, factions, unit types, or gamemodes
- **Configurable Gamemodes**: Admin selects which gamemodes are available (AAS, RAAS, Invasion, TC, Destruction, Insurgency)
- **Discord Native Polls**: Voting uses Discord's built-in poll system (max 10 options)
- **History Blocking**: Prevents re-suggesting layers from recent events
- **Multi-Language**: English and German (i18n)
- **Persistent Embeds**: Buttons survive bot restarts

## Event Cycle

1. Admin creates event (`/create_layer_suggestion`)
2. Suggestion phase opens (scheduled or manual via `/open_suggestions`)
3. Users suggest layers by clicking "Suggest Layer" button
4. Admin closes suggestions (`/close_suggestions`)
5. Admin selects or randomizes layers for voting (`/select_for_vote`)
6. Voting starts (`/start_vote`) — Discord native poll
7. Poll ends — winner saved to history
8. Repeat

## Installation

### Docker (Recommended)

```bash
cp .env.dist .env
# Edit .env and set DISCORD_BOT_TOKEN
docker-compose up -d
```

### Manual

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
cp .env.dist .env
# Edit .env and set DISCORD_BOT_TOKEN
cd bot
python bot.py
```

> Note: a local `python bot.py` from inside `bot/` writes the SQLite DB to `bot/data/layer_vote.db` (cwd-relative). Set `DB_PATH` to point at the repo-root `data/` dir if you want to share the Docker DB locally, e.g. `DB_PATH=../data/layer_vote.db python bot.py`.

## First-Time Setup (in Discord)

1. Run `/setup` with organizer role, log channel, and language
2. Run `/refresh_layers` to populate the layer cache (auto-fetched on first start)
3. Optionally configure blacklists with `/config_blacklist`
4. Optionally configure allowed gamemodes with `/config_gamemodes`
5. Create an event with `/create_layer_suggestion`
